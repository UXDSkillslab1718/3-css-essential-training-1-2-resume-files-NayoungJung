            <p>These days, people are easily exposed to various websites and decide whether they will keep using the website or not based on how it looks like. <br>This project is aimed to learn how to make the layout more attractive and use diverse softwares, such as Adobe photoshop and illustrator. </p>

            <div class="column-wide">
            <p>There's the main thought behind my artworks-How can I connect humans and computers?<br> Since I have this curiousity, I've digged into the programme called 'Processing'. <br>For the week of Programming Bootcamp, I could expand my imagination into digital environment and it gave me another motivation to develop more media art programmes.</p>
            <p>There are five artworks with different meanings and indications.</p>
            <p>The first artwork shows my personality and objects or influences around me. <br>Whenever you start the programme, lines will be randomly colored with different thickness. <br>In addition, I tried to show my abstract aspect of myself through the shapes on the screen, and the letters indicate my name.</p>
            <!second>
             <p>This is the second artwork, and I came up with an idea that how I can make a pong game in an attractive and interesting way?<br>Therefore, Other two bars are added, and the changing color function is added. <br> Since the usage of additional functions are not allowed, I made up my mind to end the game by making the color of the ball same as the background so that a player cannot recognize the ball. </p>
             <!third>
             <p>What do people do when they are affected by something around them? <br> On the third day of Bootcamp, I was wearing a wool sweater, which I like the most, and kept listening to annoying music<br> The clothes and the music inspired me to combine sound and the material on the screen. <br> In order to make the programme interactive, a user have to blow into a mic, and there will be some changes in the pattern.</p>
